Although I feel that this project is complete, it is not entirely finished. I consider it complete because you can create an account, send messages, and add profile pictures from the gallery etc. However, there are still some bugs in the system, and new functions need to be added to make it more efficient. I am working on adding new features to this project every day, and I hope to release it as soon as possible. Balancing this project with my university studies can be challenging, but I always try to find some free time to work on it.
